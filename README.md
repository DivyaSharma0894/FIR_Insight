## Research Findings

### Methodology

1. *Police Department Visits:*
   - Conducted visits to Police stations for operational insights.
   - Engaged in discussions with officers, investigators, and relevant personnel.

2. *Interviews and Discussions:*
   - Structured interviews and informal discussions with law enforcement professionals.

### FIR Characteristics

3. *Length of FIRs:*
   - Average FIR spans between 4 to 5 pages, indicating their comprehensive nature.

4. *Format of FIRs:*
   - Examined varying formats used in documenting criminal complaints.

### Existing Practices

5. *Lack of Online FIR Analysis Tools:*
   - Highlighted the absence of dedicated online platforms for FIR analysis.

6. *Manual Lookup in IPCs and Sections:*
   - Law enforcement relies on conventional methods for IPCs and sections.

7. *CCTNS Police Site:*
   - Utilized for crime tracking, with potential for further enhancements.

8-10. *Online FIR Filing, Manual Entry, and CCTNS Training:*
   - Explored the shift towards digital reporting and ongoing modernization efforts.

### User Preferences

11. *Editing Suggestions by AI:*
    - Users prefer the option to review and edit FIR content when AI suggests a different section.

## Solution

### 1. Text Analysis and Classification:

- Develop a sophisticated NLP model for understanding complaint language nuances.
- Implement transfer learning with pre-trained language models.
- Train the model on a diverse dataset of FIRs for adaptability.

### 2. Knowledge Base:

- Build a comprehensive knowledge base for IPC sections and acts.
- Collaborate with legal experts for ongoing curation and updates.
- Implement version control for accuracy tracking.

### 3. Machine Learning Model Training:

- Train the ML model using a labeled dataset for supervised learning.
- Apply feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning for enhanced accuracy.

### 4. Integration with FIR Recording System:

- Seamless integration into the FIR recording system for real-time suggestions.
- Develop APIs for effective communication between the FIR system and AI/ML model.
- Implement a robust data pipeline for efficient information flow.

### 5. Explainability and Transparency:

- Implement model explanation features for user understanding.
- Utilize LIME for transparent decision justifications.
- Integrate explanation features into the user interface for investigator verification.

## Proposed Technology Stack:

1. *Programming Languages:* Python
2. *Machine Learning Frameworks:* Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
3. *NLP Libraries:* NLTK, spaCy
4. *Web Integration:* Flask or Django
5. *Database:* MongoDB for efficient knowledge base management

## Challenges and Considerations:

- Address challenges related to understanding the multiplicity of acts by implementing additional features.
  
## Team Members & Responsibilities:

- *Anuj Tomar:* Team Lead and App Developer.
- *Deepesh Mittal:* Develops AI/ML algorithms.
- *Divya Sharma:* Researcher and the brains of the team.
- *Arpit Gupta:* OCR deployment specialist and backend developer.

## Current Progress:

1. *OCR Implementation:* Successfully implemented OCR technology for digitizing hard copy FIRs.
2. *NLP Model Training:* Currently in progress for effective complaint language analysis.
3. *UI/UX Development:* Completed the design for a user-friendly experience.

## Future Aspects:

1. *Linking with Government Database for Personal Records:*
   - Explore linking with government databases for individual historical records.

2. *Linking with Government Database for IPCs and Sections:*
   - Investigate integration for real-time legislative information access.

3. *Merging with CCTNS Site:*
   - Consider merging with CCTNS for enhanced collaboration and streamlined FIR analysis processes.
